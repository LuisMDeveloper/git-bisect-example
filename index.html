    <h2>Synopsis</h2>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect start</b> [--term-{new,bad}=&lt;term&gt; --term-{old,good}=&lt;term&gt;]
        [--no-checkout] [--first-parent] [&lt;bad&gt; [&lt;good&gt;...]] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;...]</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> (bad|new|&lt;term-new&gt;) [&lt;rev&gt;]</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> (good|old|&lt;term-old&gt;) [&lt;rev&gt;...]</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> terms [--term-good | --term-bad]</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> skip [(&lt;rev&gt;|&lt;range&gt;)...]</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> reset [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> (visualize|view)</p>

    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> log</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> run &lt;cmd&gt;...</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4"><b>git bisect</b> help</p>
    <p>This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your project’s history introduced a bug. You
        use it by first telling it a "bad" commit that is known to contain the bug, and a "good" commit that is known to
        be before the bug was introduced. Then <b>git bisect</b> picks a commit between those two endpoints and asks you
        whether the selected commit is "good" or "bad". It continues narrowing down the range until it finds the exact
        commit that introduced the change.</p>
    <p>In fact, <b>git bisect</b> can be used to find the commit that changed any property of your project; e.g., the
        commit
        that fixed a bug, or the commit that caused a benchmark’s performance to improve. To support this more general
        usage, the terms "old" and "new" can be used in place of "good" and "bad", or you can choose your own terms. See
        section "Alternate terms" below for more information.</p>

    <h3>Basic bisect commands: start, bad, good</h3>
    <p>As an example, suppose you are trying to find the commit that broke a feature that was known to work in version
        v2.6.13-rc2 of your project. You start a bisect session as follows:</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">$ git bisect start</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">$ git bisect bad # Current version is bad</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2 # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good</p>
    <p>Once you have specified at least one bad and one good commit, git bisect selects a commit in the middle of that
        range of history, checks it out, and outputs something similar to the following:
    </p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)</p>
    <p>You should now compile the checked-out version and test it. If that version works correctly, type</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">$ git bisect good</p>
    <p>If that version is broken, type</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">$ git bisect bad</p>
    <p>Then git bisect will respond with something like</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)</p>
    <p>Keep repeating the process: compile the tree, test it, and depending on whether it is good or bad run git bisect
        good or git bisect bad to ask for the next commit that needs testing.</p>
    <p>Eventually there will be no more revisions left to inspect, and the command will print out a description of the
        first bad commit. The reference refs/bisect/bad will be left pointing at that commit.</p>
    <h3>Bisect reset</h3>
    <p>After a bisect session, to clean up the bisection state and return to the original HEAD, issue the following
        command:</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">$ git bisect reset</p>
    <p>By default, this will return your tree to the commit that was checked out before git bisect start. (A new git
        bisect start will also do that, as it cleans up the old bisection state.)
    </p>
    <p>With an optional argument, you can return to a different commit instead:</p>
    <p class="bg-gray-400 rounded py-2 px-4">$ git bisect reset &lt;commit&gt;</p>
    <p>For example, git bisect reset bisect/bad will check out the first bad revision, while git bisect reset HEAD will
        leave you on the current bisection commit and avoid switching commits at all.</p>
